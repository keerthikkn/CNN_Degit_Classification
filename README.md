# MNIST Digit Classification ANN Model
This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model trained on the MNIST dataset for digit classification. The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The purpose of this model is to classify the input images of handwritten digits into their respective categories using a feedforward neural network architecture. The model has been trained and tested using the popular deep learning framework, and it achieves a high accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

## Model Architecture
The ANN model consists of the following layers:

Input layer: The input layer accepts grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, representing the handwritten digits.

Hidden layers: The model contains multiple fully connected hidden layers with ReLU activation functions. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer can be adjusted during the training process to optimize the performance.

Output layer: The output layer is a fully connected layer with softmax activation, producing a probability distribution over the 10 possible digit classes (0 to 9).

The model uses the categorical cross-entropy loss function to measure the discrepancy between predicted and actual labels during training. The optimization algorithm used is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01.

## Model Training
The model has been trained on the MNIST dataset using the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The MNIST dataset images are normalized by dividing each pixel value by 255 to obtain values between 0 and 1. Additionally, the labels are one-hot encoded to represent each class as a binary vector.

Model initialization: The neural network model with the specified architecture is created.

Model training: The model is trained using the training set images and labels. The training process involves forward propagation, computing the loss, backward propagation, and weight updates. The training continues for a specified number of epochs or until convergence.

Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the test set images and labels. The accuracy metric is calculated to measure the performance of the model on unseen data.

## Model Usage
To use the trained model for digit classification, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

Load the trained model weights using the provided file or by training the model from scratch.

Preprocess the input image to match the required format (grayscale, 28x28 pixels).

Feed the preprocessed image to the model and obtain the predicted probabilities for each digit class.

Choose the class with the highest probability as the predicted digit label.

An example usage code snippet is provided in the repository to guide you through the process.
